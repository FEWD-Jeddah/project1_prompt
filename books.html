                <p2>by Arthur Conan Doyle, Levi Stahl (Editor), Stacey Shintani (Editor), Michael Sims (Foreword) </p2>

No book published this year will bring a Holmes fan more pleasure. Come, readers. The game is afoot.</article>

                <p2>by Andrew Hodges (Foreword), Douglas R. Hofstadter (Preface)</p2>
                <article>It is only a slight exaggeration to say that the British mathematician Alan Turing (1912-1954) saved the Allies from the Nazis, invented the computer and artificial intelligence, and anticipated gay liberation by decades--all before his suicide at age forty-one. This acclaimed biography of the founder of computer science, with a new preface by the author that addresses Turing's royal pardon in 2013, is the definitive account of an extraordinary mind and life.</article>
